*Linux cheat for Black Mesa made in C.*

* Description
This cheat currently has only bhop, legit autostrafe, rage autostrafe and box
esp because, although I really liked reverse engineering this game, the
multiplayer is so dead it's not fun to continue right now.

When making this cheat, I invested most of my time in IDA, and I learned a lot
about reverse engineering because I had no cheat base, no SDK, or no other
project I could look at (I don't even think there are public sources for BMS
cheats, let alone in C and for linux).

In the process of making this cheat I made a small article about reverse
engineering, and if you are interested you can check it out [[https://github.com/8dcc/bms-cheat/wiki/Hooking-CreateMove][here]].
